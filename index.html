            <h3>Tomorrow will be second monday</h3>
            <p>Monday provides an edge to those who are ready to put in the effort. Most people when they show up to work on a Monday take a while before they get back on to their horses, and are able to give their best. You can have an edge over them because you can use that time to actually pace up, and get the most important activities done first. Yes, you might feel exhausted at the end of the day, but I promise you will also feel proud that you got the most challenging tasks of the week out of the way. As a result, the rest of the week will seem to be a smooth ride.
